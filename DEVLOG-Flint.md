## FLint Mueller

### 2025-05-23 - Update
I updated all the base files to describe the project
Also initialized rust project

### 2025-05-27 - Base code and research
I researched how to use the termion rust library.
Most of the code should be able to be handled by the library.
Then I added some boilerplate code and gave the repo some structure.

### 2025-05-28 - Fill in some io fucntions
I filled in the handle_input and display functions.
They don't quite work but the logic is there.

### 2025-05-29 - Got raw mode to work
I debugged the raw mode and got it to work.
Need to get the input to register

### 2025-05-30 - Reogranize project structure
Put some functions in their own class.
Updated main file.
